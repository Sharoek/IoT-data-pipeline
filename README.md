# IoT-data-pipeline

For this project i will be using python to create the script. It will involve the raspberry pi 3a+. 
The goal is that the raspberry should be able to use a pir motion detection to sense if someone is close.

Eventually i would like to combine this with pi door sensor (magnetic contact switch) so i can get a update if someone just opened a door.
